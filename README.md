# Pareto-Mutual-Distillation
Code for the paper Towards Higher Pareto Frontier in Multilingual Machine Translation.

This paper proposes a novel training strategy named *Parero Mutual Distillation*, which aims to push the Pareto frontier of multilingual neural machine translation.

## Install
### 1. Downloading this repository.
```git clone``` or downloading the zip directly.

### 2. Installing the dependency.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```pip install --editable ./ ```

### 3. Downloading the data file (data-bin)
Downloading the [data file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z396pP8ZfCeiJm-CMIu9EdQqFpfckAZP) and unzip these files into a user-specific data-bin path.
We conducted experiments on three datasets (TED-8-Diverse, TED-8-Related, and WMT-6).
The TED-8-Diverse and TED-8-Related are provided by [1]. The WMT6 dataset is provided by [2].

### 4. Training and Inference.
Scripts for training and inference are placed in the 'PCL_scripts'. 

Before running these scripts, **modifying the project_path, python_path, path_2_data** as:
* ```project_path```: refers to the current project.
* ```python_path```: refers to the path of python (you can obtain it by ```which python```)
* ```path_2_data```: refers to the directory of data-bin files.
